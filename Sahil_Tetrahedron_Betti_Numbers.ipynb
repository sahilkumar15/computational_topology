    "### **The Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are analyzing the structure of a **3-ball** (a filled 3D object, like a solid sphere) modeled as a **tetrahedron**. This tetrahedron has:\n",
    "1. **0-skeleton:** The 4 vertices ($q, r, s, t$).\n",
    "2. **1-skeleton:** The 6 edges connecting the vertices ($qr, qs, qt, rs, rt, st$).\n",
    "3. **2-skeleton:** The 4 triangular faces ($qrs, qrt, qst, rst$).\n",
    "4. **3-skeleton:** The single 3D tetrahedron that encloses all the faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to **calculate the Betti numbers** ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3$), which describe the topology of the tetrahedron:\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$: Number of connected components (independent points).\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$: Number of loops (1-dimensional holes, like a circle).\n",
    "- $\\beta_2$: Number of hollow surfaces (2-dimensional shells, like the surface of a sphere).\n",
    "- $\\beta_3$: Number of voids (3-dimensional spaces, like the interior of a ball).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 3-ball, there are no holes or voids, so we expect:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step-by-Step Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will calculate the Betti numbers by reducing **boundary matrices** for each skeleton. These matrices encode how simplices (vertices, edges, faces, volumes) are connected. Matrix reduction helps us eliminate redundant connections and count independent features in each dimension.\n",

    "#### **0-Skeleton**\n",
